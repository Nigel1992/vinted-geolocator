## [1.4.1] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- **Seller flagging system** - Click badge on any item to flag/unflag the seller
  - Persistent storage of flagged sellers across sessions
  - Automatic detection of items from previously flagged sellers
  - Visual 🚩/🏷️ badge toggle (top-left of items)
- **Pause/Resume control** - New toggle button in header (⏸/▶) to pause/resume processing
  - Pauses both scanning and API calls cleanly
  - Status updates reflect paused state
- **Instant cached loading** - Cached items now load immediately during scan
  - No more queue delay for previously processed items
  - Significant performance improvement on repeat visits

### Changed
- **Duplicate detection improvements**
  - Now groups by seller username when available (more accurate)
  - Changed badge icon from 🔄 to 👤 for clarity
  - Displays seller username on duplicate badges (e.g., "👤 john_d…")
  - Color-coded per seller: each seller gets a consistent gradient color
  - Repositioned badges to bottom-left of item image overlay
  - Full seller name shown in badge tooltip
- Cache format now includes seller username (backward compatible)
- Seller flag badge includes username in storage and display

### Technical
- New state: `isPaused`, `flaggedSellers` Set, `sellerBadgeColors` Map
- Seller color palette with 10 distinct gradients cycling per page
- Badge anchoring improved to use image overlay container for accurate positioning
- Duplicate badge styling: translucent gradient with subtle blur for visibility

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- **Include mode (whitelist filtering)** - Changed from exclude/blacklist mode to include/whitelist mode
  - Users now select which countries they want to **show** instead of which to hide
  - More intuitive filtering: "Include Countries" instead of "Exclude Countries"
  - If no countries selected, all items are shown; if countries selected, only those are shown

### Changed
- Filter logic inverted: display items only from selected countries (if any selected)
- Session storage key changed from `vinted_excluded_countries` to `vinted_included_countries`
- All checkbox IDs changed from `exclude-{country}` to `include-{country}`
- Status messages updated: "Showing only X" instead of "Excluding X"

### Technical
- Filter logic: `match = includedCountries.length === 0 || includedCountries.includes(item.country)`

- Maintains all other features: presets, duplicates, dark mode, caching

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-04

### Added
- **Item location caching** - Items' location data is now cached in localStorage to avoid repeated API requests

### Technical
- Cache keys use format `vinted_item_{itemId}` with JSON data containing country, city, and timestamp

- Cached items process instantly with 100ms timeout instead of 1000ms
