## Vinted Country & City Filter (Client-side) v1.4.1.1

![Screenshot](https://greasyfork.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjAyMTI5LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e0c7cd180b6a3a98fab91859d3e33e859e744675/Screenshot_2026-01-04_22-44-33-min%20(1).png?locale=nl)


### Description
This userscript enhances the Vinted website by displaying the **seller's country and city directly on item listings** with country flags and allows you to **visually filter by multiple countries**.

The script works entirely **client-side** and uses **Vinted's own public item API** to retrieve location information with **intelligent caching** that stores data forever to avoid repeated API calls.  
It does **not** modify search results, does **not** interact with your account, and does **not** perform automated actions such as buying, messaging, or following users.

Filtering is purely visual: excluded countries are faded and grayscaled, while matching items remain fully visible.  
You can **select multiple countries to include at any time**, and the results **update instantly without reloading the page**.  
When **filtering is disabled**, **no items are hidden or de-emphasized**, and the script simply displays the **country and city for each item whenever available**.

### How it works
- When item cards appear on a Vinted page, the script detects their item IDs.
- For each item, it first **checks cached location data** in localStorage, then fetches from Vinted's API if needed.
- **Location data is cached forever** to avoid repeated API calls and improve performance.
- To respect Vinted's API limits, the script processes **approximately one item per second**.
- Item information appears **gradually**, especially on pages with many listings.
- The seller's **country and city with flag** are shown as a small overlay on the item card.
- A **sleek, draggable floating menu** allows you to **select multiple countries to include**.
- Items are **updated immediately** when the filter is changed.
- **Live statistics** show matching items, total scanned, and items in processing queue.
- When **filtering is disabled**, all items remain fully visible while still showing location information.
- **Automatic captcha detection** and popup solver when API is blocked.
- **Language detection** ensures the script only works when Vinted is set to English.
- **Duplicate seller detection** highlights items from the same seller with color-coded badges.

---

### Performance and rate limits
- The default processing speed is **about one API request per second**.
- This delay is intentionally conservative to **reduce the risk of rate limiting or captchas**.
- Advanced users may **edit the script and lower the delay** to load item locations faster.
- Increasing the request speed may result in:
  - More frequent **429 (Too Many Requests)** responses  
  - **403 (captcha) challenges**  
  - Temporary API blocking by Vinted  
- Any changes to the delay are done **at the user's own risk**.

### Important notes (please read)
- **Language**: Set Vinted to **English** for the script to work correctly
- This script **uses Vinted's own API** to fetch item details.
- Because of API rate limits, item locations are **not loaded all at once**.
- Scrolling very fast or opening pages with many items may temporarily increase the queue.
- Filtering is **visual only** and does not change Vinted's internal search or ranking.
- **Duplicate detection** is based on seller usernames when available.
